# Kijiji Digital: Bridging Borders Through Technology 🌍💻

Kijiji Digital is a non-profit initiative born out of a passion to bridge the digital divide between urban and rural communities in Kenya. This web project was designed to support our mission of equipping youth in rural Kenya with digital literacy, AI integration skills, mentorship, and access to global academic opportunities.

Developed using Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this website serves as a hub for information about Kijiji Digital’s work, ways to get involved, and a storytelling platform for the youth and founders making a difference.
