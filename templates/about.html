                        I'm Steve Odira, the founder of Kijiji Digital. Growing up in Komungu Village, a small rural town in Kenya, technology seemed like a distant dream. We heard of the internet but couldn’t quite grasp its power, imagining it as something far beyond our reach. In school, we were taught to write neatly, and our handwriting became a point of pride. But today, in a world that’s driven by digital communication, that skill feels almost obsolete.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Komungu Village still lacks basic infrastructure and the expertise to equip its youth with the digital skills they need to thrive in this rapidly advancing world. Having experienced firsthand the crippling effects of both technological illiteracy and the potential of digital literacy, I realized that change was necessary. This realization led to the creation of Kijiji Digital—a mission to empower the youth of Komungu with the digital skills they deserve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kijiji Digital is more than just a project; it’s a bridge to a brighter future. Through digital education, we aim to equip the youth of Komungu with the skills to connect, create, and compete on a global stage. It’s time for Komungu to rise, one click at a time.

                        Kijiji Digital (Swahili for Digital Village) is a non-profit organization founded by U.S.-sponsored exchange alumni with a mission to bridge the technology gap for disadvantaged youth in rural Kenya. Our goal is to provide these young people with access to the wealth of opportunities available online.

                    <p class="about-paragraph">
                        Approximately 15 million youth in Kenya lack access to technology, limiting their potential and future prospects. Through our programs, we aim to empower these youths by providing them with the tools and knowledge to harness technology in their education and projects. We teach them how to integrate AI into their studies, guide them through college applications, help them create professional resumes, and equip them with the skills needed to succeed in today’s digital world.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-paragraph">
                        Additionally, many young girls in rural areas face daunting challenges due to limited opportunities and societal constraints. As a result, many drop out of school, experience early pregnancies, and lose hope for their future. Through technology, mentorship programs, and community support, we aspire to inspire these young women, help them discover their talents, and show them that the world is waiting for their unique contributions.

                    I’m Valerian Mutua, born and raised in Upper-Manza Village, Machakos. While my Kamba name might sound familiar to many, few truly understand the challenges we faced growing up—and how much my community still struggles with basic digital skills. Despite the world being deeply entwined with technology, my community remains without access to even the most fundamental computer knowledge. Many students here have exceptional handwriting, but cannot type. For my people, technology feels as distant and unattainable as Moses parting the Red Sea—almost impossible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is what drives me to be part of Kijiji Digital. I am determined to inspire and equip my community with the digital skills they need to thrive in today’s world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am an alumnus of the Global UGRAD program, a graduate of Egerton University, and I also had the privilege of studying at the University of Southern Indiana. I am deeply passionate about technology and its potential to drive social change. Join me on this transformative journey with Kijiji Digital!
