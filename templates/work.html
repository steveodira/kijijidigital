            <h2>At Kijiji Digital</h2>
            <p>We are dedicated to bridging the digital divide and empowering the youth in two vibrant Kenyan villages: Komungu Village in Homa-Bay and Upper-Manza Village in Machakos. Although these villages are 463 kilometers apart, we share a common mission to enhance digital literacy, provide college application advising, and empower young girls to unlock their full potential.</p>

            <h2>Digital Literacy Training</h2>
            <p>In both Komungu and Upper-Manza, we teach youths ranging from 7 years old to individuals in their 20s how to effectively use computers and harness the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in their everyday lives. Through a project-based learning approach, we focus on practical skills that teach our students how to complete tasks digitally and optimize them further using AI tools. This hands-on approach equips young people with the knowledge and skills they need to thrive in the digital age, opening doors to endless opportunities in education, employment, and entrepreneurship.</p>

            <h2>College Application Advising</h2>
            <p>Many bright and ambitious students in these villages face challenges when it comes to applying to colleges abroad. There is a lack of knowledge on how to apply to institutions in the US, Europe, and other parts of the world, as well as how to explore scholarship opportunities and navigate the application process. At Kijiji Digital, we answer these questions by offering guidance and support throughout the entire college application journey. We empower students with the information they need to explore options, craft compelling applications, and take the first step toward achieving their academic goals.</p>

            <h2>Young Girls Empowerment</h2>
            <p>In both Komungu and Upper-Manza, many young girls and adolescents' dreams are often hindered by early pregnancies and limited opportunities. We strive to create mentorship sessions where young girls can receive inspiration, guidance, and encouragement from women who have overcome similar challenges and succeeded in their careers. We believe that hearing stories of success and resilience is one of the most powerful motivators for young women. In addition to career mentorship, we also provide education on menstrual hygiene, empowering girls with knowledge that supports their health and well-being. Through our programs, we aim to create a supportive and empowering environment that helps young women recognize their potential and aspire to a brighter future.</p>
